### Fast, Free & Private way to sign PDFs
A simple static in-browser app that allows you to sign PDFs.
Developed due to the apparent lack of simple, free & user-friendly PDF signing solutions. The app is completely client-side and does not send user data to any servers. You can select images of your signatures & initials from your device and the app will place a random initial or signature in the PDF where desired. Once done you can download the signed PDF.
